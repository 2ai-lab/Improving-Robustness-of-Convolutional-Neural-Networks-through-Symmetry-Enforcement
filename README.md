# Rotational and Scale Equivariant Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with rotational and scale equivariance. The CNN is designed to work with image data, particularly in the context of image classification tasks.



## Introduction
The provided code implements a custom CNN architecture with rotational and scale equivariant convolutional layers. These layers aim to capture rotational and scale-invariant features in the input data, making the model suitable for a variety of image recognition tasks.

## Running the Code
To run the code:
1. Create python vitual environment and activate it.
    1.1 For Windows:
    cd path/to/your/project
    python3 -m venv venv_name
    .\venv_name\Scripts\activate

    1.2 For macOS/Linux:
    cd path/to/your/project
    python3 -m venv venv_name
    source venv_name/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main.py file
    python3 main.py
